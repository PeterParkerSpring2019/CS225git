# DataStructures
CS225 course Spring 2019. DON'T EVER use copy and paste. If you look at this code, you need to write it from scratch. Use this only as a resource for hints. DO YOUR OWN ASSIGNMENTS, but don't waste your time. This semester was taught by Craig Zilles but uses the same structure as Wade's for the past 2 years.
