mp_intro (simple stuff - requires no CS225 knowledge to do. May be a little difficult learning the PNG and HSLA files and C++)
mp_stickers (can't remember much about this one -- I think it was trying to get us comfortable with C++ still)
mp_lists (first Big MP -- deals a lot with complicated linked list code. Understand the solution and edge cases. Debugging is Annoying)
mp_traversals (The HARDEST MP -- office hours will help with this one IF you go early. Look at lab_trees iterator traversal for ideas)
mp_mosaics (my favorite mp, but I had all spring break to figure it out. Logic is VERY in-depth, so draw out many examples beforehand)
mp_mazes (Again, the logic is stupidly in-depth. I spent 5 hours drawing it out with my best friend, and we passed all cases on first try)
mp_stories (Very simple 'logically'. But this MP is EVIL! the type names are annoyingly difficult. Logic of AdjLists is important though)

(Side-note: although the labs aren't worth a lot of points at all, they ARE the most important resource in this class.)
    (Most exams are styled directly like the labs, and rarely ever focus on MP's. So use labs to help understand MP's and study
    for exams!)
    
(Also, these early labs aren't too important, just showcasing programming and C++ skills that won't directly help you once you 
hit trees in this class up until the very end. Specifically lab_trees/btree/hash/heaps are probably some of the more heavy mp-like
labs you'll encounter this semester. Start these early and maybe attend multiple labs because that's what I did).

intro - debug - memory - inheritance - quacks - trees - huffman - avl - btree - hash - heaps - dict - ml - flow

(quacks is where the labs start getting harder and MUCH MORE important so pay attention once you hit quacks)!!!
